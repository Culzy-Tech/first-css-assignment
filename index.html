        CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a fundamental technology used in web development to control the presentation
        and layout of web pages. Imagine HTML as the skeleton and content of a webpage, while CSS serves as the skin,
        determining how that content looks and is presented to users.
        At its core, CSS consists of a set of rules that define how HTML elements should be displayed. These rules can
        specify attributes such as colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and more. CSS follows a cascading order, meaning
        that multiple styles can be applied to the same element, and the browser will prioritize them based on
        specificity and order of declaration.
        One of the key concepts in CSS is selectors. Selectors target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them.
        For example, you can target all paragraphs (`
        p) or specific elements with a class (.) or ID (#`) attribute.
        CSS also supports inheritance, which means that styles applied to a parent element can be inherited by its
        children, reducing the need for redundant styling.
        Another important aspect of CSS is its responsiveness. With media queries, developers can apply different styles
        based on factors like screen size, allowing websites to adapt and look good on various devices, from desktop
        computers to smartphones.
        CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and libraries like Sass or Less further simplify styling by providing pre-written
        CSS code and additional functionalities.
